ros-indigo-openni-camera (1.9.3-3saucy) saucy; urgency=high

  * [fix] Remove several using namespace std
    - They cause compilation failure (on OS X 10.9 with clang defaulting
    to C++11)
    - Failure occurs because unique_lock and friends is both in namespace
    std and namespace boost.
  * [fix] Don't pass unsafe strings as format strings for printing
    Doing so causes build errors under -Werror=format-security. If there
    were to be a % (percent symbol) in the exception string (whether
    intentional, malicious or otherwise), the print function could
    expose memory or cause segfaults.
  * [fix] #28 <https://github.com/ros-drivers/openni_camera/issues/28>, properly parse device_id with only numbers
    The fix checks wherever an string device_id parameter is set
    or a device_id integer parameter is set. If both are missing
    it opens the first device found. If integer device_id is set
    then it parses it to string and load continues as if string
    version was set.
  * [sys] Add travis config for indigo, jade
  * [sys] Update maintainer

  * workaround: remove some calls that segfault later
    unless this patch is applied, the driver will segfault later
    when querying the prime sense serial id.
    the fact that this patch is necessary is somewhat fishy and
    an indication that the other patches are probably not quite
    correct.
